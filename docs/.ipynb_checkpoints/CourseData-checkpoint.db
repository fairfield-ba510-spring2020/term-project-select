    "- CSV files are best imported using the SQLite3 tool we discussed in class. Experiment with it to get the imports right before writing any SQL.\n",
    "- You will likely have to import the CSV file data into tables that you will ultimately drop when the database is completed. To keep track of them all, please the prefix the table name with `import_` to indicate that the table contains raw source data.\n",
    "- Use SQL to create and populate the tables in your ERD. The code will likely look a lot like what we did in class, with lots of JOINs. You should implement FOREIGN KEY constraints (With cascading updates/deletes) as well.\n",
    "- Capture all of your SQL DDL and DML code in a new notebook called `CourseDataETL.ipynb` in this project folder. Use Markdown to annotate your work as you go along. Also, make sure you can re-run your code from scratch to rebuild the database when needed."
