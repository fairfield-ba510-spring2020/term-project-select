__2. Design a normalized relational database that can contain all CSV data in your `SourceData` repository. Document the design with an ERD and a data dictionary.__


- Also in the `docs` folder, add a Markdown-formatted `CourseDataDictionary.md` file that defines every column on every table. Use the table names as second level headings (`##`) and bullet lists for the column definitions. If you are feeling frisky, then perhaps use Markdown tables instead of bullet lists.  
- Take care with the [Markdown formatting](https://github.github.com/gfm/). Dropping big, stupidly-formatted blobs of text is very bad form. It's also extremely unprofessional.
